  ## Installation

  You install it via github, use npm i to install packages, start up a MongoDB database to connect to the localhost, seed the database using node utils/seed.js, and finally use node index.js to start it up. It is recommended to use Insomnia to test all of the routing.

  ## Usage

  It is used as a simple beginning for a social network API that allows what is generally considered the base for one. It can be expanded upon as much as a future social network app needs.
